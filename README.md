# Custom Promise in TypeScript

A TypeScript project that demonstrates how to create and extend custom promises to suit specific use cases. This project showcases how to build custom promises with additional features like logging, time tracking, and retry mechanisms, while maintaining the benefits of type safety that TypeScript offers.

## Features
- **Custom Promise Creation**: Learn how to create a basic custom promise class by extending TypeScript's native `Promise` class.
- **Logging and Time Tracking**: Implement custom methods to log the time it takes for a promise to resolve or reject.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Create promises that automatically retry a failed operation a given number of times before rejecting.
- **Error Handling**: Extend custom promises to handle errors in a more structured way.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how you can extend and customize the native promise functionality in TypeScript. Whether you're building a custom API or adding specialized logic for your asynchronous tasks, this project provides a foundation for creating more complex promise-based solutions.

## Installation
